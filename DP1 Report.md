<h3 id="who-were-the-participants">Who were the participants?</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Participants</strong> consisted of three people who had never visited the E3 building (specifically, the E3-1 &amp; E3-2 building) in KAIST</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="how-did-we-choose-these-participants">How did we choose these participants?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Three of us each asked one acquaintance who met the recruitment criteria (i.e. unfamiliarity with KAIST’s E3 building)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-task-did-we-give-to-these-participants">What task did we give to these participants?</h3>
<ul>
<li>We asked the participants to find a certain number of rooms and amenities in a building that they’ve never visited before as quickly as possible.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-did-we-observe-in-the-tasks">What did we observe in the tasks?</h3>
<p>We tried to observe:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How</strong> the participants reacted when given the destination and what thought process they went through during the task.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> actions the participants took in general.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="what-were-the-interview-questions">What were the Interview Questions?</h3>
<p>Interview questions were same for all participants / interviewees:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>How</strong> did you find the destination? <strong>Tell me</strong> your thought process to find each goal.</li>
<li><strong>Tell me</strong> about the last experience you got lost in a KAIST building. <strong>Where</strong> was it and why were you lost?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> do you want to know <em>before entering a new building</em>? Why?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> do you not like about <em>physical maps</em> (i.e. paper maps, floor plans etc.) and why?</li>
<li><strong>What</strong> features would you have in your <em>ideal electronic indoor map?</em> Why?</li>
</ol>

<li>Relies on intuition to find rooms in new building (User Story)
<ul>
<li>Needs to find room #2427 in the MSE</li>
<li>From surroundings he knew it was at 2nd floor because he looked around and saw rooms all starting with #23</li>
<li>so he simply went to 2nd floor and found with little effort-</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>“Hard to use intuition [above] in this experiment since I was in the middle of nowhere"</em><br>

</ol>
</li>
<li><strong>Interesting Moments:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Rooms in E3-1 are easy to find if you know the room number. For example, room #1433, it is on the first floor, and there are labels on the wall, that guide the visitor in the correct direction.</li>
<li><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/NlLUMR0KXCGLIyazie2W7dTWwoI09pJumHbpn7mbtpN5E_iN7HrP-4GP_9QpPgt-HyQ2ZjEz-XHPU1FvsfywB7jbduHt3Z9ZFElKlX_X7r0TtUjjZPXsJjem226gkAt5EBYk18b7BpQ" alt=""></li>
<li>Shared her story of getting lost at E3-2 building. Had a lecture at E3-2, 1220. Could not find the room on the first and second floors. Then, asked korean student for help, who carried her to the administration team and they showed her the room. The search took 22 minutes in total including walk from E-9 to the E3-2, as a result was late to the lecture.</li>

<ol>
<li>As a ME major, Participant #3 normally never have to visit E3-1 building.</li>
<li>However, one day, while he was strolling down the street, he suddenly had the urge to go to the bathroom but the only building he could find was E3-1</li>
<li>As it was a weekend, there were no one in the E3-1 building.</li>
<li>So he had to resort in primitive methods to find the location to the bathroom using maps.</li>

<li><strong>Find</strong> the desired destination
<ul>
<li>Derived through our extreme user’s time-critical user story</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Locate</strong> a map around them to help find their destination
<ul>
<li>Derived through looking through every participants’ need to search a map or floor plan around them to quickly locate their desired location.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Learn</strong> the surroundings quickly so that one can compare their surroundings with the map
<ul>
<li>Users need to adapt themselves to their surroundings (so they can use their intuition/recall)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Explore</strong> opportunities within that building
<ul>
<li>Desire to know available resources of the building</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Desire</strong> to easily recall the physical map</li>
<li><strong>Desire</strong> to understand the legends in the available map</li>
<li><strong>Accomplish</strong> finding their destination quickly with minimal effort.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify</strong> their task of acquiring necessary knowledge to find their destination</li>

</ol>
<h2 id="insights">Insights</h2>
<ol>
<li>Current <strong>floor plans</strong> in KAIST has low usability
<ul>
<li>Participants tried to use the currently available indoor maps but didn’t gain any help from them at all they lack description of each rooms &amp; available amenities.<br>
<img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jck9IPhgpI7yQynOR-LX9BSwiqgBN1arYVqp8pUUBAM92rmJGTnF35PIRJkcP5bYEVA5n3cG7kNrj9z5tj6gsHRGxF2pXkLTVQVn8URFsEaxsu496wm4k7_ranXXnLcrkC-3T2XVKLY" alt=""></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sometimes had to use external help to find place</li>
<li>Some features of a building aren’t well known to a new person in a building</li>
<li>Users used “intuition” to find their destination</li>
<li>Users want to have a unified platform while searching for their destination ^^</li>
<li>Users desired an immediate sense of direction by having a map before entering a building to tailor it for their needs.</li>
<li>Users wanted to spontaneously know their current location and ascertain the route to the destination from their current location</li>
<li></li>

<h2 id="studio-reflection">Studio Reflection</h2>
<h3 id="studio-feedback">Studio Feedback</h3>
<ol>
<li>(Positive Feedback) <strong>I like</strong> that you <strong>designed</strong> <strong>many different tasks</strong> to discover diverse difficulties the target users might have. It is also great that you tried to get users’ opinion on ‘ideal’ indoor map.</li>
<li>(Constructive Feedback #1) <strong>I wish</strong> you had discussed about the occasion the interviewed users looked for indoor map <strong>instead</strong> of using their intuition. What made them <strong>give up</strong> using their <strong>intuition solely</strong>, and what do they want at that specific points?</li>
<li>(Constructive Feedback #2) Needs and Insights are very similar to each other. Note that two have different functionality in your design process.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="studio-reflection--plans-to-address-feedback">Studio Reflection &amp; Plans to Address Feedback</h3>
<ol>
<li>The positive feedback was very constructive for our Design Project as it <strong>confirmed that we were in the right track</strong> for our observation &amp; interview questions.</li>
<li>We realized that we only identified how users relied on their intuition and under which conditions, whereas we should have recorded more information on their “relationship” with indoor map. Perhaps additional questions should have been asked to track down the thought process when they were using intuition to not only understand the “what” and “why” but also “when”. This feedback was duly noted by our team.</li>
<li>After receiving this feedback, we reconsidered and reworded our previous needs and insights <strong>to tailor to the accurate functionality</strong> for our design process.</li>
