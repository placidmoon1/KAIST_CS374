<h2 id="pov">POV</h2>
<p>In the User-Need-Insight form:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We met</strong> with a visitor of the E3-2 building of KAIST who had never visited this particular building.</li>
<li><strong>We were amazed to realize</strong> that he <strong>struggled</strong> to find his destination inside the E3-2 building despite using a indoor map provided by the building.</li>
<li><strong>It’d be game-changing to</strong> help him find his destination faster while minimizing the effort in doing so.</li>
</ul>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivations, beliefs, preferences, and goals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivations</strong>: Had to spend lots of time to search for his destination by being dependent on indoor maps with low usability and people who usually give vague directions.</li>
<li><strong>Beliefs</strong>: Being punctual to all meetings and events (i.e. not being late)</li>
<li><strong>Preferences</strong>: Arrive at his destination earlier than the meeting time to avoid unexpected happenings that can make him  late.</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>:  <strong>Reduce</strong> time in getting to his destination in a new indoor environment &amp; If he arrives early, wants to <strong>utilize</strong> his leftover time in discovering the indoor environment he is in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Story</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Though his busy schedule often prevents him from doing so, Bill wishes to efficiently discover the indoor environment he is currently in.</li>
<li>As Bill arrives at his desired location earlier than the meeting time, he has some time to spare to fulfill his wish.</li>
<li>However, the last time our persona tried to do this, there wasn’t an efficient method in doing so as the provided indoor maps on the building were difficult to understand and were stuck on a wall which made them not portable.</li>
</ul>
