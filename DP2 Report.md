<h2 id="pov">POV</h2>
<p>In the User-Need-Insight form:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>We met</strong> with a visitor of the E3-2 building of KAIST who had never visited this particular building.</li>
<li><strong>We were amazed to realize</strong> that he <strong>struggled</strong> to find his destination inside the E3-2 building despite using a indoor map provided by the building.</li>
<li><strong>It’d be game-changing to</strong> help him find his destination faster while minimizing the effort in doing so.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="persona">Persona</h2>

<ul>
<li>Name: Bill</li>
<li>Occupation: Businessman</li>

</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Motivations, beliefs, preferences, and goals</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Motivations</strong>: Had to spend lots of time to search for his destination by being dependent on indoor maps with low usability and people who usually give vague directions.</li>
<li><strong>Beliefs</strong>: Being punctual to all meetings and events (i.e. not being late)</li>
<li><strong>Preferences</strong>: Arrive at his destination earlier than the meeting time to avoid unexpected happenings that can make him  late.</li>
<li><strong>Goals</strong>:  <strong>Reduce</strong> time in getting to his destination in a new indoor environment &amp; If he arrives early, wants to <strong>utilize</strong> his leftover time in discovering the indoor environment he is in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Story</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Though his busy schedule often prevents him from doing so, Bill wishes to efficiently discover the indoor environment he is currently in.</li>
<li>As Bill arrives at his desired location earlier than the meeting time, he has some time to spare to fulfill his wish.</li>
<li>However, the last time our persona tried to do this, there wasn’t an efficient method in doing so as the provided indoor maps on the building were difficult to understand and were stuck on a wall which made them not portable.</li>
</ul>

<ol>
<li>Is it interactive?</li>
<li>Does it optimize the three dimensions of usability?</li>
<li>Is it fun?</li>
<li>Is it helpful for the users?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>HMW #1: HMW make map finding like a game? Like reading a book?</strong><br>
- <strong>Suggest random, yet fun places within indoors that users might visit</strong><br>
- Have hidden gadgets in the building with hints such that users can find it (similar to easter egg hunt).<br>
- Have collectibles in certain locations of the building.<br>
- Provide some sort of incentive when visiting landmarks within a building.<br>
- Provide checkmark points while user is finding their way to their destination.<br>
- Recommend different types of routes to destination (fastest, most story-filled, most amenities-available, can access amenity X along the way etc.)<br>
- Provide extensive histories / information for each room<br>
- Social platform for room information editing<br>
- Social platform for tag selection of rooms (i.e. fun, useful, informative, awestrucking, etc.)<br>
- Combination of previous paths that previous users took.</p>
<p><strong>HMW2: HMW improve the usability of floor plans (indoor map) in a building?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Highlights the user’s route</li>
<li>Colorize the map according to commonly acknowledged colors (bathroom is blue, red is exit)</li>
<li>Show the user’s current destination</li>
<li>Include filters for showing certain features or types of rooms</li>
<li>Increase dimensionality of the map (3D) to show certain features that are not possible in 2D plane</li>
<li>Noticeable/Visible from afar (instead of having to come up close to see small details)</li>
<li>Speech support (map talks to user) &amp; increased accessibility in general (not limited to, but especially helpful for blind individuals)</li>
<li><strong>Add brief description of the room/feature or pictorial description (emojis?) or even a picture of the actual destination</strong></li>
<li>Text-based descriptions of room locations or arrows to indicate a general direction instead of showing bird eye’s view of the entire map floor plan</li>
<li>Emphasize the most commonly used and popular places in some way and highlight their location</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>HMW3: HMW reduce the external help (that may not always be available) needed for users to know their route?</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Provide all the information a user would need in one platform (AGGREGATE all the data)</li>
<li><strong>Before user enters, the user is provided with a path to the destination (e.g. by getting interface of building through QR codes)</strong></li>
<li>Make available signs in the building more noticeable and visible to the user</li>
<li>Social platform so users can share routes/features</li>
<li>Peer-to-peer communication (visitor communicates directly with person in the destination) and they can view a map in real-time that they can both see. (Could be similar to chatbot?)</li>
<li>Communicate route information in “human language” (by “English language”)</li>
<li>Filter specialized information like professor’s rooms and other “special info” (to show the location)</li>
<li>Provide auxiliary information such as a restaurant’s working hours, TA office hours, menu at cafeteria, events going on inside a building</li>
<li>Provide multiple pictures of their route and destination rather than a floor plan (wouldn’t fit the user model and what they see around them)</li>
<li>Send user real-time GPS info about their current location for dynamic pathfinding (similar to Google Maps)</li>
</ol>

<ol>
<li>Overall very strong studio presentation</li>
<li>However, would’ve been better if the POV was more concise and contained operative definitions of certain terminologies.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="studio-reflections">Studio Reflections</h2>
<ol>
<li>Thank you for your feedback; we really appreciate your comments and we were glad to here that we were in the right track with our topic and presentation.</li>
<li>We had modified our POV (Point Of View) such that terminologies were operatively defined such that people who have minimal knowledge with our topic can still accurately understand our POV.</li>
