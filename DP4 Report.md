<h2 id="pov--tasks">POV &amp; Tasks</h2>
<h3 id="pov">POV</h3>
<ul>
<li>We met with a visitor of the E3-2 building of KAIST who had never visited this particular building.</li>
<li>We were amazed  to realize that he struggled to find his destination inside the E3-2 building despite using a indoor map provided by the building.</li>
<li>It’d be game-changing to help him find his destination faster while minimizing the effort in doing so.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<p>Tasks are <strong>radically different</strong> than the paper prototype so that we can have user testing of our <strong>newly created feature</strong> –  <strong>user-created tasks</strong> – and receive many feedback and note observations.</p>
<ol>
<li>Find the location of a specific type of general amenities (i.e. Cafés)</li>
<li>Find the location of a user created event.</li>
<li>Create a user-created event</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="prototype">Prototype</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Link to prototype:</strong> <a href="https://invis.io/PEGQFWHWBVX">https://invis.io/PEGQFWHWBVX</a></li>
<li><strong>Prototyping tool:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Marvel App:</strong> <strong>Marvel App</strong> was used as our digital template creation tool as it had several general templates for web page design such as a text input box or gallery. This allowed us to efficiently allocate time for other things.</li>
<li><strong>InVision:</strong>  <strong>InVision</strong> was used to link all the digital template created in Marvel App and add events to associate the templates. We chose InVision as our lo-fi prototype realization tool as InVision allowed programming events such as “on click of a button, change screen to a different preprogrammed screen” without actual programming, which made modifying events easy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Design Choices:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Only implemented the most basic yet essential things that the user can follow to conduct the three tasks. This kind of <strong>minimalistic</strong> design choice was chosen by our team to maximize time efficiency.</li>
<li>Manual algorithm is implemented. The user needs to <strong>strictly</strong> follow the predesigned algorithm in order to complete the tasks.</li>
<li>There are dummy buttons that is not programmed with events. These are for design and layout purposes that will be eventually implemented in mid-fi prototype and beyond.</li>
<li>Could not receive input of current location in the lo-fi prototype as the prototyping tool that our team used didn’t allow text inputs / qr code inputs . Rather, we had a fixed current location.</li>
<li>Current location was only received through the simulated QR Code. The QR code screen can be changed only if a button is clicked. Normal behavior of a QR input screen is automatic change once QR code data is read. However, as that cannot be simulated, we added a manual button that, when clicked, would move on to the next page.</li>

<li>We were asked if <strong>QR codes was the only source of entering the location.</strong> Although there were two sources of input of location ( QR code and text input), it appeared it wasn’t clear for the users. For future implementation, we would try to use clear icons for location input that approaches to the users in an intuitive manner.</li>
<li>We were also asked to have a home button for every page so that user can reset their results. We added a home page button in the toolbar fixed in the top so that the user can reset their result even in the map screen. We also a map button in the toolbar fixed in the top so that the user can go to the map screen directly</li>
<li>We were complimented that we had some good insights in the paper vs digital section. THank you. We spent a lot of time in that section as we knew the importance of implementing a lo-fi prototype!</li>
