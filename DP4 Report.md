<h3 id="pov">POV</h3>
<ul>
<li>We met with a visitor of the E3-2 building of KAIST who had never visited this particular building.</li>
<li>We were amazed  to realize that he struggled to find his destination inside the E3-2 building despite using a indoor map provided by the building.</li>
<li>It’d be game-changing to help him find his destination faster while minimizing the effort in doing so.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="tasks">Tasks</h3>
<p>Tasks <strong>remain the same</strong> as the paper prototype since we thought that the previously defined tasks <strong>encapsulate numerous features</strong> of our prototype.</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the route to (the fictional) “Professor Juho Kim’s office” in respect to your current location.</li>
<li>Find a list of nearby cafes and route to your preferred one.</li>
<li>Locate a place in your current floor that you want to visit.</li>
</ul>

<li>Link to prototype: <a href="https://invis.io/PEGQFWHWBVX">https://invis.io/PEGQFWHWBVX</a></li>
<li>Prototyping tool:
<ul>
<li>Marvel App: Used to create the digital template for every screen.</li>
<li>InVision:  Used to link all the digital template created in Marvel App and add events to associate the templates</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Design Choices:</li>
<li>Representative screenshots:</li>
<li>Instructions:</li>

<li>We were asked if <strong>QR codes was the only source of entering the location.</strong> Although there were two sources of input of location ( QR code and text input), it appeared it wasn’t clear for the users. For future implementation, we would try to use clear icons for location input that approaches to the users in an intuitive manner.</li>
<li>We were also asked to have a home button for every page so that user can reset their results. We added a home page button in the toolbar fixed in the top so that the user can reset their result even in the map screen. We also a map button in the toolbar fixed in the top so that the user can go to the map screen directly</li>
<li>We were complimented that we had some good insights in the paper vs digital section. THank you. We spent a lot of time in that section as we knew the importance of implementing a lo-fi prototype!</li>
